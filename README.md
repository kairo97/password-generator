# password-generator
##A JavaScript password generator
*this application is meant to be a randomized password generator. In its current state it does not function as it should, I will continue updating it as I can to make it function properly.
this application works through prompt windows and user inputted choices to generate a password between 8 and 128 characters long, with the option to input uppercase letters, numbers and special characters.
